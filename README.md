## About The Project

This project details the process of creating and validating a privacy-preserving synthetic dataset for heart failure research. We used five different generative models (TVAE, NFlow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and TabDDPM) to generate synthetic data from a real-world cohort of 12,552 patients. The code includes scripts for:

* Data preprocessing
* Training synthetic data generation models
* Comprehensive evaluation of statistical fidelity, machine learning utility, and privacy.
